// Considerations:
//  - This needs to be at least the alignment of any usual data type.
//  - It's useful that this is at least the size of a cache line to limit
//    possible cache side effects (if only on performance behavior).
//  - It's useful that this is at least the size of SIMD registers, as
//    some SIMD instruction sets have at least performance behavior
//    differences (e.g. NEON) or even different requirements (e.g. SSE)
//    based on that.
//  - It's useful that this is at least the size of an "exclusive reservation
//    granule" on ARM, meaning that if we use this Allocator to allocate
//    an atomic variable, there will be no side effects from other things
//    contending for exclusive/atomic memory accesses to it. While the
//    ARM reference manual mentions that this granule size may be as large
//    as 2048 bytes, in practice we observe it to be 64 bytes. It can
//    be queried cheaply, at runtime, from userspace, if needed.
